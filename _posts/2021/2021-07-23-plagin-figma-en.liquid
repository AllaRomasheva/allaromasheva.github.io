This is a plugin that works with a document generation tool called Coda. Thanks to this plugin you can fill in layouts
data from services such as Spotify, Wikipedia, Dropbox, Gmail, Google Calendar, Jira, Shopify, Github, etc.

### LilGrid

This is a plugin that will bring order to your interface. It takes all the disordered elements in the system and organizes
them into a grid that you determine for yourself.

This is especially useful when you need to organize a large number of buttons or icons in your design system.

LilGrid does not change the elements of your design, but only arranges them on the canvas.

### Table Paste

This plugin will be very useful for those who need to transfer data from Excel spreadsheets to stylized spreadsheets created in Figma.

You create a table row in Figma with a text box for each cell, and then make a component out of it. Then you create a table with
these rows and select the rows of the table to which you want to apply the data.

Then in Excel you need to select the data and copy them to the table Figma. Voila, your Excel spreadsheet is now stylized as Figma.

### Design System Organizer

This plugin helps with organizing such items in a user-friendly interface. It allows you to group components, ungroup them,
move and rename grouped components.

When you rename a group, the name will be changed for all components or styles in that group. And you don't even need to use it
search and replace tools for this.

A great plugin from the creators of the Must App. Super useful for those who want to create an application or site dedicated
to movies and TV series.

The main function of the plugin is that it arbitrarily fills any vector object you create with an image or poster.
movie, or TV show.

### Color Kit

This plugin will help you generate light and dark shades of the color you want. This is useful when you need to create
color gradations.

And if you are familiar with Eva Design System - a third-party application that generates colors, you will like this plugin
because it performs a similar function, but you do not need to leave Figma.

### Material Palette

This plugin was created for Material Design fans who love to create Material palettes. Now, saving your time,
you can create palettes directly in Figma.

You have 3 types of palettes available: Material, Monochrome and True monochrome. We hope in the next Google update
will update this palette because some colors contain huge gaps and require balancing.

### Wire Box

Quite an interesting plugin. If you have ready-made Hi-Fi solutions, you can quickly create interface layouts. But this plugin
helps turn a high-precision layout into low-precision weirframes if you want to focus on
UX component of the project.

### Vector Maps

The Vector Maps plugin allows you to upload vector maps of countries, regions and cities to Figma layouts.

Finding a country or region is quite simple - you can search by name or select them on the map.

The vector map will be imported into Figma as a separate frame.

### TinyImage Compressor

You can use this plugin when exporting images. It compresses the size of your files up to 90% better than exporting
default with Figma. This plugin has many interesting features: it supports not only file compression and export
various sizes and formats, but also optimization of transparent PNG and progressive JPEG files. TinyImage Compressor
remembers settings during export. When exporting multiple images, the plugin automatically exports them as a ZIP folder.

### Design Lint

This stunning free Figma open source plugin checks for discrepancies in your layouts
(ie finds missing styles in your projects in all layers - checks colors, fonts, effects, fills, strokes,
border-radius) and corrects inconsistencies. Moreover, it works dynamically, which means that when making corrections
during operation, Design Lint will be automatically updated according to the corrections you have made.
