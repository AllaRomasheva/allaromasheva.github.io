<b>The main mistakes in the work of the target audience</b>

The main mistakes in the work of the target group are:

- The whole purchase chain is not taken into account. Before creating content and advertising, it is important to understand
the process of buying a product.
- The target audience is overestimated. This is a common mistake for VIP audiences. Instead of a sober look at its CA,
marketers are beginning to idealize it.
- Lack of segmentation. If you divide the customers, you can upgrade the product or service for different categories of
customers.

The most important key parameters for determining the target group are its habits and hobbies. The product or service must
decide buyer's problem. He has a need that needs to be met, you have something that helps. The company's task is to become
component of this formula: when I need it, I mention the brand.
