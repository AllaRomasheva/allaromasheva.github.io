In June 2021, the ArtHuss publishing house and the Projector Institute launched a joint series of professional literature 
- PRJCTRteka.

Since Projector educates creative industry professionals and ArtHuss publishes such books, this collaboration made it 
possible to understand exactly what young professionals need. This series aims to publish more than 50 professional books
in Ukrainian on the topics of graphic design, animation, management, creativity, game development, interface design, etc.

So far, 4 books have been published in the series.

### 1. Hand drawn animation with Preston Blair

"We decided to start with "Drawn Animation" by Preston Blair, because the author of the book is a cult animator of the 
Disney studio. Because it is worth learning from the best. It is this idea that we support in the publishing house."

Drawn Animation with Preston Blair brings together two iconic guides, Animation and How to animated films". Blair willingly 
shared the secrets of art, experience and his own work on the pages of his books.

The manual consists of six chapters covering the basics of animation, character development, their movements, cartoon 
construction, principles of animation and acting. Already from the first pages it becomes clear: Preston Blair does not 
focus on theory(there is relatively little text here), but on concentrated practice. Using numerous examples, the author 
teaches the art of bringing pictures to life people, animals and objects. This is a comprehensive book that teaches the 
basics of drawing characters, characters, movements, and principles of animation- everything you need to create your own 
cartoon.

### 2. Writing is Design: How Words Create User Experience (UX)

The authors of the book, Michael Matts and Andy Welfl, work professionally with the texts. Both in the field of journalism 
and while doing work a content strategist in Adobe's product design team. They teach how to work with texts for applications, 
bots, programs, because without words, applications would be just a set of shapes and icons, and voice interfaces and 
chatbots would not exist at all.

This book will teach you how to make software human-centered. A book of practical advice on Clarity and Inclusivity texts, 
following the voice of the company and the product, the right choice of tone. And intended for readers who work with texts,
manage the content strategy for software interfaces, designers and art directors, all those who lead the team, managers

help to understand with the team and create a harmonious result.
