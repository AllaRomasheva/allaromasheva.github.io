## What is a design system?

In summary, a design system is a set of standards to manage design at scale by reducing redundancy and maintaining consistency. 
A design system is a collection of documents, articles, examples, code snippets, screenshots, design guidelines, components, 
philosophies and other digital assets for a product design company. It’s usually hosted online as a website (public or internal).

## What can you learn from them?

So how can you learn from this? Say you’re designing a e-commerce website and the menu needs a dropdown for categories. 
Not sure what size your arrow should be on the dropdown or how far away from the text to place it? Well, you can look to 
a shopping system pioneer like Shopify to see how they do it!
