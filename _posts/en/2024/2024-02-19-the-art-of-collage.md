### The main thing about the art of collage

As an art form, collage emerged at the beginning of the last century thanks to the work of such famous artists as Pablo Picasso,
Henri Matisse and Georges Braque. It was they who invented the term "collage". Although an artistic technique that involves 
the use of different materials such as paper and cloth existed long before that.

With the advent of digital technology, collage has gone beyond the process of manual cutting and pasting. This is how 
digital collage appeared, which became even more experimental. Unlike a traditional collage, it is created by superimposing 
various images and textures. For this, they use programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator and many other applications.

   way.

3. Versatility.
   Do not think that collages are appropriate only in the creative field. Literally any brand can integrate them into its communication.

   from the creative side.

4. Visual storytelling.
   Thanks to the use of different images, whole stories can be created in the collage, which will effectively attract the audience and definitely
   will cause them an emotional response.

#### 1. Decide on a topic
A theme is the basis of your design, which will determine the choice of images, colors and composition, as well as set the 
overall mood work Start with a general idea and focus on the associations it evokes. Great ways to narrow down your topic 
and make a decision with a common vision will be brainstorming.

#### 2. Create a moodboard
Once you start working with associations, you can move on to finding references and sources of inspiration. These can be 
images, materials (for example, newspaper clippings or pieces of fabric) — in a word, everything that fits into the theme 
of the collage and conveys it mood. Having collected all the elements, you can see a complete picture.

#### 3. Choose the relevant colors

#### 4. Think over the composition
The main role in creating a visually attractive composition is played by balance. It is about such placement of visual 
elements, so that no part of the design looks overloaded or, on the contrary, empty. To achieve this you can use the rule 
of thirds and white space, which allows you to balance the "heavy" elements.

#### 5. Add layers
Layering adds depth and interest to a collage, turning a flat image into a three-dimensional work. To create this one
effect, start with the background layer, which will be the basis for the following elements. Start adding them one by one 
as you build volume and visual variety.

#### 6. Experiment with textures
Textural elements create almost tactile sensations that give collages a unique character. Choose different textures
— from rough concrete to delicate flowers. And don't be afraid to combine them, because thanks to unusual combinations, 
your design will look good much more effective.

#### 7. Use special effects
With the help of Photoshop, you can create a special aesthetic in your collage, from retro-futuristic to anime. Also
we recommend using filters and masks to blend different layers in a collage so that the final result looks holistically
