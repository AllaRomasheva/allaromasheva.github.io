perception site, mood and associations they have with the product or brand. In this article, we will look at several steps 
that will help you choose a color scheme for your site.

mood do you want to transfer For example, if you are developing a site for children, it makes sense to use bright, saturated 
colors, while darker and more subdued colors may be suitable for a financial company's website.

### 2. Use a color palette

If you have no previous experience with color selection, using a color palette can help you. The palette is a set of colors 
that are harmoniously combined with each other. Some websites like Adobe Color or Coolors can generate palette for you 
based on the selected starting color or using algorithms based on color theories.

### 3. Use color theories

There are many color theories that can help you choose a color scheme for your website. One of the most common is a color 
wheel theory based on the relationship between colors on the wheel. For example, a harmonious color scheme can include 
colors that are on opposite sides of the color wheel, such as blue and orange, red and green, an analog color scheme is 
a scheme that uses colors that are next to each other on the color wheel wheels, for example red, orange and yellow. The 
"triad" color scheme uses colors that are on equidistant from each other on the color wheel, for example red, yellow and 
blue.

style for your brand and facilitate easy recognition of your brand by users.

### 5. Use contrast

Contrast between colors can help make your site more attractive to users. Use of colors with great contrast can help make

look on different devices and in different lighting. Also pay attention to what associations are evoked your colors, and 
change colors if they don't convey the desired mood or match the brand identity.
