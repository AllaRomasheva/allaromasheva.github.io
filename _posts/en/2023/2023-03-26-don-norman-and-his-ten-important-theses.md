Prominent design researcher Don Norman has released a new book, Designing a Better World.

In Designing a Better World, Norman explores the ethics of modern design, the issues of consumerism, overproduction, and 
sustainable development. Digitization. Here are 10 main theses from the conversation with Don Norman, which was moderated 
by Slava Shestopalov.

### Real needs of people

We are people first and foremost, not consumers. Design fails when it focuses instead on meeting people's real needs on 
problems invented by marketers. (At the same time, marketers know how to convey their opinion better than designers, so 
theirs the voice often prevails.) In different regions of the world, people have different needs. For the design to be 
successful, it is necessary to develop it attract directly the people for whom it will be created.

### Designers must lead

When we talk about successful projects, the achievements are usually attributed to the CEO, the COO, product leaders and 
other representatives of the top of the company. Why don't we say in the same spirit about the chief designer, whose
contribution is also important? In many places, there is no position of a design director who would sit in the board of 
directors and decide jointly important decisions with other managers.

### Ethics of design

Business considerations rule the world, and it's wrong. We must constantly pay attention to the ethics of the products 
we create. Do they harm the people around them? Do they cause environmental pollution? Do not contribute to the spread 
of inequality and injustice in the world? Our work, as designers, is not reduced to a simple craft. Of course, you should 
be able to speak in the language of business. However, we have to think about more than just profits, because in this case 
we are not fulfilling the true mission of design.

### Overproduction

New product models come out too often. Why create a product over and over again that is not much different from previous 
versions? For example, new models of cars are released every year, but their design is updated only every three to four 
years. The reason is that updating the design of a car is very expensive. So why produce and buy new models so often?
The novelty of a thing becomes a sign of the status of its owner, and this is a destructive way for the environment. 
Despite the fact that it is impossible to change instantly system, at least it is worth thinking about possible ways of 
development.

### Politics applies to everyone

Yes, you Ukrainians know this well. Design is not apolitical either, we humans create artificial environments for ourselves 
and they don't always function in a fair manner. Nowadays, any large project contains a political component, and it is 
worth considering this, become aware of the consequences that our work can cause. In today's world, you can't say anymore
"it doesn't concern me", because, most likely, it concerns you.

### New education

There are many useful skills that we are not taught in educational institutions. A designer's education cannot be purely 
design "in a vacuum" without any practical application. The foundation of the new education will be cooperation, mutual 
assistance, free distribution of knowledge We have to share the experience gained, because it is the next generations who 
will invent the answers to the questions we have now we don't even put it. The global knowledge base is constantly 
accumulating and we have to accelerate this process with all our might.

### Artificial intelligence is a tool

Humanity has always been anxious about new technologies. Designers should not be afraid of losing their jobs because of 
neural networks, because the strongest will be those specialists who have an open and unbiased attitude towards AI technologies. 
Take it as a given, because progress cannot be stopped. Generative design will open unprecedented opportunities for those 
brave people who are ready with enthusiasm to learn something completely new.

### It is worth thinking more broadly

In today's world, it is not enough to be good at your specialization. Designers should be not only craftsmen, but also certain
extent by generalists. After all, design is needed in order to make life around more comfortable and to build an increasingly 
better future for future generations. That is exactly why design thinking should be widely used in many spheres of life.

### Design is capable of everything

Design can help solve real problems: environmental, economic, political, or any other. For example, in Ukraine there is 
a problem with corruption, and designers can also contribute to inventing a solution to it. Design should be useful
our society and meet the real needs of people, and designers should be interested in politics and get involved in it,
because much depends on governments and laws.

### More identity

I began to notice that in today's globalized world, Ukrainian design is not much different from Japanese design, and 
Mexican from Italian. It seems to me that the loss of national design identity is happening because everyone designers 
study from the same books and strive to follow current trends. Get rid of these restrictions, there is nothing wrong with 
a Mexican doing Mexican, and a Ukrainian doing Ukrainian.
