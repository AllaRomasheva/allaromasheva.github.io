white space and take your projects to a new level. So let's get down to business!

### What is white space

White space, also known as negative space, is the part of a design or layout that remains empty. In essence, it is a space
that surrounds or separates design elements such as text, images, and graphics. White space may be used deliberately or 
arise accidentally, but in any case it plays an important role in the design, determining its overall appearance and perception.

When used effectively, white space creates a clear visual hierarchy where important elements stand out and less important
strengthen them. This can help draw the viewer's attention to key parts of the design and make the message easier to understand.

#### 1) White micro- and macrospace

White microspace is the space between individual characters, lines of text, and words. It affects the clarity of the design.
Designers often adjust it to make the text more readable. For example, you can change the line spacing to blocks of text 
to create more white microspace and facilitate perception.

Macro white space is the space between design elements such as paragraphs, images, and headings. It affects the general
design composition and helps create visual balance and hierarchy. White macrospace can separate headings from the main 
text or secondary elements from the main design components.

#### 2) Active and passive white space

Active white space is purposefully left empty to create a specific effect. Designers use it, to draw attention to a certain 
part of the graphic, to give movement and energy to the image or to highlight the main message. Active white space can be 
a powerful tool to make your design more attractive and dynamic.

Passive white space occurs randomly between design elements. It can appear when items are not properly ordered in a way 
that creates a confused design. You should be aware of passive white space and try to avoid it if you want to create 
elaborate graphics.
