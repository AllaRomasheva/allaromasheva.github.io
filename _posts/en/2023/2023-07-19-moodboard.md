### What is a moodboard?

Moodboard (also called "mood board" and "inspiration board") is a set of specially selected images that convey the emotional 
context of the brand or product.

A moodboard can literally be a board to which a designer attaches printed images, drawings, and other elements (such as
scraps of fabric or dry leaves) to convey the mood of your projects. But most designers use digital moodboards, which makes 
it possible to work on them as a whole team.

Pinterest is a great tool for creating mood boards for personal use.

Designers prefer more versatile cloud platforms like GoMoodboard, Polyvore and StudioBinder.
These tools use templates, which helps the designer save a lot of time. Many of them allow you to work team over the project 
and edit the moodboard from different devices. Crello, a template-based graphics editor from Depositphotos, can also be 
used to create a mood board and present it (select the Presentation template).

graphic editors. They transfer their work to the client in the form of instructions or recommendations for the design and 
marketing departments.

have to think its design or visual communication. In this case, the moodboard helps to structure the creative process and 
develop the idea, and then save it.

#### You work in a team

The most important thing in teamwork is to stay on the same wavelength during the implementation of the project. A moodboard

the product (for example, on interface design and visual communication in social networks).

#### You need to discuss the interim result with the client

Moodboard can be called the first tool for collaboration in the history of design. Even in the form of cardboard with pins,
with magazine clippings and abstract sketches, it performs the main function - it gives the designer an opportunity to explain 
his vision and allows other team members to make changes.

#### You want to avoid costly mistakes

### 6 steps to creating a first-class moodboard

Designers from different disciplines and teams may have different strategies for creating moodboards. Brand designers start 
by studying competing products and receive a well-thought-out reference as a result. Modelers prefer physical boards
moods and collect on them not only images, but also materials. Our step-by-step guide will be especially useful for graphics
designers

creative ideas?

style of the future product or to develop its complete concept, including functionality and positioning.

“coffee” and “coffee shop”. Add to that the design requirements from your client and other product features you learned 
about during the research phase (eg “family business”, “muted color palette”, “minimalism”, “millennials”). Also pay 
attention to the competitive niche and target audience of the product.

Add to the moodboard images that symbolize all the key attributes of the product, the visual context of the target audience,
competitive environment and customer requirements.

#### Step 3. Study and research

The new is the well-forgotten old. Someone has already worked on a similar project in the past and most likely achieved 
great things success Study the design of similar products and add the most interesting options to the moodboard.

Try digging deeper! You may need to turn to history to come up with a great design idea. find out how similar products 
looked before. If you find an unusual solution, add it to the board.

#### Step 4: Use artwork, neon signs, photos, and whatever inspires you

It's time to get a little creative. Add images that are not directly related to your task, but inspire you. It can be 
anything from your favorite Japanese engraving from the 16th century to a flyer that you like given on the street.

You can also use animations, audio recordings and even poems. At this stage, you can also turn to stock platforms such as 
Depositphotos. Choose your favorite images and videos, save them to "Favorites" or download and add them on the moodboard.

in advance with help moodboard Look for fonts and colors that visually blend with what you've already added to the board. 
Even if in the future you will have to design your own font, with references it will be much easier.

#### Step 6. Finalize the moodboard

At this point, you need to categorize everything you've added to the board. Remove repetitions and highlight references,
which most accurately convey the "mood" of the project.

Even if you are not going to present the moodboard to the team or the client, try to make it so that an outside observer
could understand your train of thought. To do this, use arrows, captions, image scaling and various composites techniques
