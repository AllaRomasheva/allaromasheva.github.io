### Classification of fonts

Font families are a classification system that groups fonts into different groups based on their shared characteristics 
and design features. It helps designers and typographers understand the relationship between different fonts, making it 
easier to choose and combinations of fonts for different projects. Fonts can be conditionally divided into the following 
categories:

- Old style
  Fonts such as Garamond and Caslon have a moderate contrast between thick and thin strokes, as well as distinctive bevelled 
  serrations.

- Transitional
  With sharper serrations and higher contrast, typefaces like Baskerville and Tinos fill the gap between the old
  style and modern fonts.

- Modern
  These fonts have a high contrast between thick and thin strokes, are characterized by minimal serrations or
  their absence, like Bodoni and Didot.

- Bruskovi
  Fonts like Rockwell and Clarendon have heavy, blocky serifs and are often used for emphasis.

- Grotesque fonts without serrations
  Early sans-serif typefaces, like Franklin Gothic and News Gothic, have minimal contrast and a somewhat crude appearance.

- Neo-grotesque fonts without serrations
  Fonts like Helvetica and Arial are known for their simplicity, clean lines, and even stroke widths.

- Humanist fonts without serrations
  Fonts like Gill Sans and Frutiger are influenced by traditional serif typefaces with subtle variations stroke widths.

- Geometric fonts without serrations
  Futura and Avenir fonts are based on geometric shapes and have a modern, minimalist look.

### 5 factors to consider when choosing a font

#### 1. Audience and target market.

When choosing a font, always keep in mind the audience you are trying to reach. Consider her age, interests and preferences.
A playful, casual font may be ideal for a children's book, while a professional, concise font is more appropriate
for a corporate report.

#### 2. Goals and objectives of the project.

What is the main goal of your project? To inform, entertain or persuade? The choice of font should be appropriate for the 
purpose. For example, for an informative article will need a font that is as legible as possible, while an advertisement 
may benefit from a font with a unique style.

#### 3. Readability and legibility

Readability is how well you can read and understand words and phrases, while legibility is how easily you distinguish them
individual symbols. Choose a font that is both legible and legible, especially for large blocks of text.

#### 4. Communication style

Think about the tone of your content. Is it formal or informal? Carefree or serious? The choice of font should
complement and reinforce the overall message. The wrong font can create confusion or even undermine your message.

#### 5. Compatibility with other design elements

The font you choose should blend harmoniously with other elements such as colors, images, and layout. Importantly
maintain visual consistency throughout the project so that the font does not distract from the content.

### 7 key principles of successful font combination

#### 1. Contrast

The cornerstone of a successful font combination is contrast. Try to create a visual balance by combining fonts with different 
ones characteristics such as notched and unnotched, heavy and light, decorative and minimalist.

#### 2. Complementarity

While contrast is vital, fonts should also complement each other in mood, style and visual appeal.
Fonts that share common characteristics, such as stroke height or width, will help create a cohesive look.

#### 3. Hierarchy

Create a clear typographic hierarchy by choosing different fonts or font styles for headings, subheadings, and body text.
This not only improves readability, but also guides the reader's eye through the content.

#### 4. Consistency

Ensure design consistency by using the same fonts for similar types of content, such as headings and subheadings, captions, 
and highlighted quotes or body text and lists.

#### 5. Limit

For a cohesive design, limit your font selection to two or three typefaces. Too many fonts can create visual clutter and 
distract from the message you're trying to convey.

#### 6. Topic

Make sure the fonts you choose share a common trait or theme to create a cohesive design. This can be achieved by
choosing fonts from the same typeface, fonts designed by the same typographer, or fonts with similar design elements.

#### 7. Experiments

Try different combinations of fonts and test them in different sizes, devices and contexts. This will help determine which 
ones combination will work best for your project and provide optimal readability and visual appeal.
