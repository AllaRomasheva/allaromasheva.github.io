### What makes Pinterest unique?

Pinterest is an online platform for finding, storing and sharing images. Unlike other social networks such as Facebook,
Instagram or Twitter, it does not emphasize the components of the social network.

User engagement on the platform is very limited. That's why Pinterest is mostly filled with creative ideas and motivational
content, not selfies, toxic comments or fake news. To prove that ideas are more valuable than likes, the creators of Pinterest
even removed the "Like" button a few years ago. The company said that it is easier for users to interact with content
without her. Pinterest has taken care to remove all the excess and let you enjoy your visual finds in peace.

Plus, Pinterest doesn't use a feed algorithm, so your Pins stay there forever! They appear again and again if you enter 
a relevant keyword in the search. This means that Pins are longer lasting than posts in other popular ones social networks
