Some useful plugins for Figma that will save you time

On the one hand, ease of use is a strong point of the Figma editor. On the other hand, there are tasks that require use
additional programs. The use of plugins will help reduce the number of such tasks and optimize routine processes.
Well, we decided to help in their search and made a selection of 20 plugins that, in our opinion, will be useful in work.

### Figmotion

This plugin works as a full-fledged tool for creating animations directly in Figma. With this plugin you can
create basic animations without having to jump into separate tools like Principle, Haiku, or After Effects.

Creating an animation is quite simple:

1. Select the frame you want to edit;
2. Start Figmotion by clicking the right mouse button (plugin — Figmotion);
3. Use the usual timeline and diamond button to change the element's style at a specific moment;
4. You can start the animation with the "play" button and render when you are satisfied with the result.

Note: The play button will save the animation on the Figmotion server, so just press the last play button,
and it will redirect you to the animation.
